#can we use word2vec to interpolate a line?
#y = 5x + 2
#x values of (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) given (in that order) as input walk/sentence
#define y values for 1, 3, and 5, try to interpolate 2 and 4
#first value is node/word (x), second is embedding value (y), third is quality (1-sticky)
#set quality = 1 for no movement allowed
